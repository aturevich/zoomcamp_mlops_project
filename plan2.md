2. Cloud Infrastructure (4 points)
   - Develop the entire project on Google Cloud Platform.
   - Use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage GCP resources.

3. Experiment Tracking and Model Registry (4 points)
   - Implement MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.
   - Host MLflow on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Google Cloud Run.

4. Workflow Orchestration (4 points)
   - Use Prefect for workflow orchestration, deploying a fully automated pipeline.

5. Model Deployment (4 points)
   - Containerize the model using Docker.
   - Deploy the model as a web service using Google Cloud Run or Google Kubernetes Engine.

6. Model Monitoring (4 points)
   - Implement comprehensive model monitoring using Evidently AI.
   - Set up alerting and conditional workflows for model performance issues.

7. Reproducibility (4 points)
   - Provide clear instructions in the README for running the code and reproducing results.
   - Use virtual environments and specify all dependency versions.

8. Best Practices (7 points)
   - Implement unit tests and integration tests.
   - Use linter and code formatter.
   - Create a Makefile and pre-commit hooks.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud Build.
